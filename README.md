this is a file about a game
the idea comes from a Chinese old myth called "hou yi she ri",which tells a story of a hero with a bow shot down nine suns in the sky and left only one there. He saved people from the deadly heat.
far from the epic myth, this game is relaxing and very easy to play. and it's mini too, contains only about 2Mb.
we play this by tap on the phone or click on the screen and pull back then release,there the arrow would fly up to hit the suns.you can aim by the black line drawing on the screen between your two tap or click positions.
